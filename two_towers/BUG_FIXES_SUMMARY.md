# Critical Bug Fixes Applied

## üêõ **Bugs That Were Fixed**

### **Bug 1: Data Leakage via Duplicate Random Splits**
**Problem**: The code was creating two identical datasets and applying the **same random split** to both:
```python
# Training data split
train_dataset, val_dataset, test_dataset = torch.utils.data.random_split(dataset, [60%, 20%, 20%])

# Evaluation data split (SAME SEED!)
eval_train_dataset, eval_val_dataset, eval_test_dataset = torch.utils.data.random_split(eval_dataset, [60%, 20%, 20%])
```
This caused **massive data leakage** - same user-movie pairs in both train and validation!

**Fix**: Eliminated duplicate datasets entirely and implemented proper user-level splitting.

### **Bug 2: Interaction-Level vs User-Level Splitting**
**Problem**: Random splits were applied at the **interaction level**, meaning:
- Same user could appear in train, validation, AND test sets
- Model could memorize user patterns during training and encounter same users during evaluation
- **Artificially inflated performance** due to user memorization

**Fix**: Implemented **user-level splitting**:
- Users are split into train/val/test groups **first**
- Each user appears in **only one** split
- No user overlap between train/val/test

### **Bug 3: Duplicate Dataset Creation**
**Problem**: Code was creating two identical datasets:
```python
dataset = MovieLensDataset(...)           # For training
eval_dataset = MovieLensDataset(...)      # Same data, just for evaluation
```
This wasted memory and created opportunities for bugs.

**Fix**: Single dataset approach with proper splitting by user groups.

## ‚úÖ **What the Fixes Accomplish**

### **1. Proper Data Isolation**
- **No user overlap**: Each user appears in exactly one split
- **No data leakage**: Training never sees validation/test users
- **Realistic evaluation**: Model tested on completely unseen users

### **2. Deterministic Splits**
- **Fixed random seed (42)**: Reproducible splits across runs
- **Consistent user assignment**: Same users always in same splits
- **Debugging friendly**: Logging shows exact split composition

### **3. Memory Efficiency**
- **Single dataset creation**: No duplicate data structures
- **Proper data filtering**: Only relevant interactions loaded per split
- **Clean architecture**: Simpler, more maintainable code

## üìä **Expected Impact on Results**

### **Previous Results (With Bugs)**
- **Precision@10**: 4.62% (artificially inflated due to data leakage)
- **Recall@10**: 46.2% (inflated)
- **MRR**: 0.215 (inflated)

### **Expected Results (After Fixes)**
- **Lower but realistic metrics**: True performance without data leakage
- **More honest evaluation**: Actually testing generalization to new users
- **Production-ready**: Performance you can expect in real deployment

## üîç **Verification Added**

### **Logging Enhancements**
- **User split verification**: Logs exact counts per split
- **Overlap detection**: Assertions ensure no user appears in multiple splits
- **Configuration verification**: Shows which loss type and negative sampling used

### **Example Log Output**
```
=== DATA SPLIT VERIFICATION ===
Training: 1200 interactions from 180 users
Validation: 400 interactions from 60 users  
Test: 350 interactions from 60 users
Loss type: sampled_softmax, Needs negatives: True
=== STARTING TRAINING ===
```

## üöÄ **How to Test the Fixes**

### **Run with Fixed Code**
```bash
cd two_towers/
poetry run python scripts/model_training.py
```

### **What to Look For**
1. **User split logging**: Verify no overlap in user counts
2. **Realistic metrics**: Expect lower but honest performance
3. **Stable training**: Should converge properly without data leakage
4. **Consistent results**: Multiple runs should give similar results

The fixes ensure your recommendation system evaluation is **honest, reproducible, and production-ready**!
